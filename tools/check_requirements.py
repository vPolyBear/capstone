"""A blunt first-pass linter for a requirements document.

Usage:  python3 check_requirements.py [path]        (default: docs/requirements.md)

It reads a Markdown requirements file written in the house shape:

    ### FR-<AREA>-<nn> — <name>       (or the flat form: ### FR-<nnn> — <name>)
    **Priority:** Must | Should | Could | Won't
    **Requirement:** <Actor> shall ...
    **Rationale:** ...
    **Acceptance criteria:**
    - Given ..., when ..., then ...

It cannot tell you whether a requirement is *right*. It can tell you that one is
unmeasurable, compound, solution-biased, unprioritised, or untestable. Every
finding is a prompt to think, not a verdict. Exit code 1 if any ERROR is found.
